# Vancouver-Walkability-Analysis

We worked together with the City of Vancouver and CityStudio Vancouver to investigate what the future of transportation and road networks may look like in the Vancouver in 2040. In particular, we chose to focus on analyzing walkability around the city, with consideration of the benefits of increasing walkability and barriers that must be overcome to make Vancouver more walkable.
